Welcome to my blog! I'm currently a J1 student at Hwa Chong.

Here I post about some of my interests:
- Cybersecurity (CTF and practice challenge writeups)
- Powerlifting
- Philosophy

I usually play as `0x3af72` under the team [elio](https://ctftime.org/team/306882/). Some of our accomplishments in local CTFs as a team include:
- Cyberthon 2025 (1st)
- Lag and Crash 2025 (1st)
- CDDC 2025 (4th)
